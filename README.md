[TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques) — Assignments
Status: ⏳ Work in progress

📚 Overview

This repository contains my own solutions to the programming assignments from the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

The work here demonstrates:
My personal implementation of course exercises
Use of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras for advanced deep learning tasks
Topics such as custom layers and models, custom training loops, distribution strategies, TFRecord pipelines, and generative deep learning
